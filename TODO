-GUI redesign
---------------------
* Module installation/removal gui:
    possibilities:
    1a) separate from tweak gui, use drag and drop interface
    1b) use icons do designate special slots (similar to player inventory gui)
    --OR--
    2a) redesign module list frame to look more like vanilla Minecraft inventory...
    2b) redesign modular item selection frame to look more like vanilla inventory and use stock inventory background icons
    2c) add "craft and install" ability back into the install/remove frame
    --OR--
    3) something else

* Keybinding frame:
    - module icons and binding icons can end up outside the clickable area ... fix this

* Module selection frame:
    - add selecting of already chosen module...
    - fix selecting module not always working

* Better flight
    - add elytra style flight (gliding, powered flight) with hovering when stationary

* Finish recipes
    - self explanatory

* External mod integration (big one):
