#MachineMuse Modular Powersuits

Modular Powersuits is a Minecraft mod based around the idea of an inventor who tinkers with high-tech electronics and makes a suit of powered armor chock-full of useful gadgets and features. Inspired by heroes like Iron Man and Megaman as well as by the high-tech armor in mods like IndustrialCraft 2 and EE2.

#Issues
This mod is no longer under active development. I (lehjr) no longer have access to upload any new versions of MPS. Furthermore, a recent openJDK8 update killed the development environment for 1.12.2, and there will be no support from Forge to fix this. Lastly, all effort is going into Modular Power Armor, a successor to MPS. https://github.com/lehjr/ModularPowerArmor
